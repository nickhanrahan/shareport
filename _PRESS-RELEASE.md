There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
SharePort

## Sub-Heading ##
A site for retail investors to test the performance of their portfolios or an investment strategy.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
On this website, the users can construct model portfolios and open them up to public criticism. Their portfolio will be locked in at its investments' prices at the time they are created. Over time, other users on the website can see the progress of this portfolio over time and comment on its performance.
## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
Serious discussions about investments on social platforms are hard to find.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
An investment tracker with social features makes the primary focus of the platform about investments.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
"The average investor may lose a toe following investment advice on social media. These discussions need to happen independently." -Nick H

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
Create a user, and you will be able to see other models created by other users. To create your own portfolio, the user will search yby ticker or company name and add investments according to their strategy. Once submitted, the portfolio is immutable by the user and is up for judgment.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
"The bank took my house and my wife left me. I got it all back with help from SharePort!" -Rick Faang

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
Take a look at the strategies our users have submitted on our site. You will see what works and what fails. It is usually the reasoning behind each portfolio that makes it a learning experience so by turning the portfolio into a conversation, you can see why some perform well or don't.
